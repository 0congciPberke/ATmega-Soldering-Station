# ATmega-Soldering-Station
T12 Quick Heating Soldering Station featuring
- Temperature measurement of the tip
- Temperature control via rotary encoder
- Boost mode by short pressing rotary encoder switch
- Setup menu by long pressing rotary encoder switch
- Handle movement detection (by checking ball switch)
- Iron unconnected detection (by idenfying invalid temperature readings)
- Time driven sleep/power off mode if iron is unused (movement detection)
- Measurement of input voltage, Vcc and ATmega's internal temperature
- Information display on OLED
- Buzzer
- Calibrating and managing different soldering tips
- Storing user settings into the EEPROM

Power supply should be in the range of 16V/2A to 24V/3A and well
stabilized.

For calibration you need a soldering iron tips thermometer. For best results
wait at least three minutes after switching on the soldering station before 
you start the calibration process.
