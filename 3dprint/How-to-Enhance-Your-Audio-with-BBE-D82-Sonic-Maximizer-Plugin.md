## How to Use the BBE - D82 Sonic Maximizer Plugin
 
The BBE - D82 Sonic Maximizer plugin is easy to use and has a simple interface with four main controls: Low Contour, Process, Output Level, and Bypass. Here is how to use them:

- Low Contour: This control adjusts the amount of low-frequency boost or cut applied by the plugin. It ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being no boost or cut and 10 being maximum boost or cut. You can use this control to add more bass or reduce muddiness in your audio.
- Process: This control adjusts the amount of high-frequency enhancement applied by the plugin. It ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being no enhancement and 10 being maximum enhancement. You can use this control to add more brightness or clarity to your audio.
- Output Level: This control adjusts the overall output level of the plugin. It ranges from -12dB to +12dB, with 0 being no change. You can use this control to match the input level or increase or decrease the volume of your audio.
- Bypass: This control toggles the plugin on or off. When it is on, the plugin processes your audio according to the settings of the other controls. When it is off, the plugin bypasses your audio without any processing.

To use the plugin, simply insert it on an audio track or a master bus in your audio software application and adjust the controls according to your preference. You can also choose from one of the presets provided by Nomad Factory or create your own presets and save them for future use. The plugin allows you to compare your processed audio with
